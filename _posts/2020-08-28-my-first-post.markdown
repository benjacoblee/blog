It **really** shouldn't be this hard to set up a blog.

_rant over_

Hi. My name's Ben.

I'm an software developer situated in sunny Singapore.

Recently, some level of introspection has led me to this conclusion: the ability to problem-solve is simply _not enough_.

One also has to be able to externalize - to be able to explain the step-by-step process for which a solution was derived. My baseless assumption is this: if we can externalize, we can perhaps replicate the process to reliably solve problems of a similar nature.

And that's why I've started this blog:

-   to serve as a means to keep track of my thoughts
-   to remind myself of the steps I took to solve a problem
-   to serve as a time capsule for my progress

If you happen to chance upon this blog - I hope that there will be something of value to you.

Peace!
